DESCRIPTION:

The Interactive Quiz Application is a dynamic, responsive web-based quiz game developed using core front-end technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed and implemented as a solo project, this application offers users a fun and engaging way to test their knowledge through a series of multiple-choice questions. With built-in features such as score tracking, real-time user feedback, and score saving, the app provides a complete quiz experience right in the browser—no installations or back-end setups required.

🎯 Project Objective
The main goal of this project was to build an intuitive, interactive quiz platform that operates entirely on the front-end. It serves as a great demonstration of DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage usage in JavaScript. The application provides a smooth user experience, encouraging learning in an entertaining format.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML – For structuring the content and quiz layout

CSS – For styling the interface with responsive and clean design principles

JavaScript – For quiz logic, score tracking, interactivity, and local storage handling

✨ Key Features
✅ 5 Multiple-Choice Questions
The quiz consists of five curated questions, each offering four answer choices. Questions are dynamically loaded one at a time, allowing users to interact seamlessly with each.

✅ Real-Time Feedback
Once a user selects an answer, the application immediately responds with visual feedback—highlighting whether the choice was correct or incorrect. This ensures instant learning reinforcement.

✅ Score Tracking
As users progress through the quiz, their correct answers are tracked. At the end of the quiz, the total score is displayed to give users a sense of achievement and progress.

✅ Restart Functionality
Users can restart the quiz anytime using a built-in "Restart Quiz" button, which resets the question counter and score, allowing for repeat attempts and learning improvement.

✅ Score Saving with Local Storage
The application leverages the browser’s local storage to save the user's most recent score, even after a page refresh. This feature adds a persistent layer to the experience, enabling users to revisit their performance.

✅ Clean and Responsive UI
Designed with simplicity in mind, the interface is mobile-friendly and responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across various screen sizes and devices.
